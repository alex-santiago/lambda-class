# About myself

After my Computer Science degree I spent 15 years in Tech company that developed products for Financial and Health Care companies. One of my managers from this company recruited me to work in a implementation project for a Healthe Care Provider. It was a 2 year contract. She needed someone who could lead a team to work in the implementation. There I did most of the migration of legacy customer data and also coordinated with the Consulting team from system. 

When my contract was about to finish I decided to come to Canada to study Web and Mobile development to update and have some internaational experience.

In august a friend call me and offered me a contract for the company that I am currently working to develop an app using Xamarin Forms. This is a open contract that I work some hours each month. This is entire new product that I am resposible to build the UI and later integrate with an API.

Now I am looking for a permanent position that offers me the opportunity to keep working with mobile or web development.
