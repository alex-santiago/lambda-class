My name is Alexandre, and I am from Brazil. I arrived in Canada in 2016 to study in the Web and Mobile Development and Design Program at Langara College.

I have over 12 years of experience in research and product development for the Health and Financial industries. Experienced in Java, c#, JavaScript, HTML and CSS, databases like MS SQL Server, MySQL and Oracle.

I also have experience in project management using PMI Organization standards. I am always on the lookout for the latest trends in frameworks and tools to further develop my skills.
