      <description>What is a Custom Renderer A Custom Renderer is a developer made Renderer Class that customises the appearance and behaviour of a UI control. The Renderer Class is responsible for creating the Xamarin.Forms representation of pages, layouts or controls for each platform (IOS, Android or Windows Phone). An alternative to Custom Renderers is the development of Custom Controls through subclassing.
The Custom Renderer Class is a derived class implementation of the Renderer Class responsible for rendering the corresponding UI object in each platform.</description>

      <description>0x a Node.js Optimization Tool I will show a tool called 0x that generates a Flame Graph. My goal is to give an overview of the tool. You can access a full step by step tutorial and learn how to use it by accessing the full article in TUNING NODE.JS APP PERFORMANCE WITH AUTOCANNON AND 0X by Ron Litzenberger. This tool was presented at the Node Interactive North America 2017 Node.</description>

      <description>About the new CSS Grid Layout Module aka CSS Grid CSS Grid is a new method of using a grid concept to lay out content in an HTML page. It provides a mechanism for developers to divide available space for layout into columns and rows using a set of predictable sizing behaviours. CSS Grid will not only make it easy for developers to layout the most complicated designs but also, will make it possible to create designs that could not be implemented through other available solutions, such as Flexbox.</description>

It uses the same IDE, language, and APIs to code apps for Android, IOS and Windows Phone.</description>
